## <b>EEPROMRW application for X-NUCLEO-PGEEZ1 Expansion Board based on M95P32 SPI EEPROM and STM32 Nucleo Boards Example Description</b>

The X-NUCLEO-PGEEZ1 expansion board is designed for M95P32 series SPI EEPROM for data reading and writing

The expansion board acts as an external storage device that can be used to store
data such as manufacturing traceability, calibration, user settings, error flags, data
logs and monitoring data to make applications more flexible and accurate.

Known limitations:

- When starting the project from Example Selector in STM32CubeMX and regenerating it
  from ioc file, you may face a build issue. To solve it, if you started the project for the
  Nucleo-L053R8 board, remove from the IDE project the file stm32l0xx_nucleo.c in the Application/User
  virtual folder and delete, from Src and Inc folders, the files: stm32l0xx_nucleo.c, stm32l0xx_nucleo.h
  and stm32l0xx_nucleo_errno.h.
  The same operations apply if you starts the project for another STM32 Nucleo board (e.g. for
  Nucleo-G474RE, the files to be removed are stm32g4xx_nucleo.c, stm32g4xx_nucleo.c, stm32g4xx_nucleo.h
  and stm32g4xx_nucleo_errno.h).

### <b>How to use it?</b>

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
- WARNING: before opening the project with any toolchain be sure your folder
   installation path is not too in-depth since the toolchain may report errors
   after building.
   
- Open STM32CubeIDE (this firmware has been successfully tested with Version 1.13.2).
   Alternatively you can use the Keil uVision toolchain (this firmware
   has been successfully tested with V5.37.0.0) or the IAR toolchain (this firmware has 
   been successfully tested with Embedded Workbench V9.20.1).
   
- Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory.

- Run the example.

- Alternatively, you can download the pre-built binaries in "Binary" folder included in the distributed package.
